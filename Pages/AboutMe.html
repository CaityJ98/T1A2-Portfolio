            <p>My name is Caitlyn, I'm 23 years old and currently residing in Ballarat, Victoria. I have just
                completed
                my Bachelor of Business and am in my second month of
                the Flex Track course at Coder Academy. This will give me the skills to allow me to become a Full
                Stack
                Developer. I currently have experience in Responsive Design, HTML & CSS.
                I am very excited to progress with this and gain employment in Web development once my course has
                finished. If you would like to get in contact with me please follow the link at the bottom of the page.
            </p>
