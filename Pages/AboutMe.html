    <p>My name is Caitlyn, I'm 23 years old and currently residing in Ballarat, Victoria. I have just completed my Bachelor of Business and am in my second month of 
    the Flex Track course at Coder Academy. This will give me the skills to allow me to become a Full Stack Developer.
    I am very excited to progress with this and gain employment in Web development once my course has finished.
