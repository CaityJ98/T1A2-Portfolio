                Maisie is a 6 year old Irish Wolfhound X Staghound. She loves going on adventures and meeting new dogs.
                She often forgets her size though and ends up scaring the other dogs. Whilst she is the most gentle creature
                to have walked this Earth her size does occasionally go against her. She loves getting some pets and attention
                and will sook loudly until she does.
