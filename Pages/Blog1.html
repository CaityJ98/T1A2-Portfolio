                One of my passions is travelling. I went to Germany when I was 14 years old as part of an exchange and that really
                kicked the travel bug into gear for me. I have travelled around Victoria and Australia and my 2 recommendations are in Victoria.
                 My favourite place in Victoria would have to be Bright. It's a small tourist town in the Alpine region. In Autumn, the leaves on 
                every tree in the town change colour. This results in a large rainbow effect throughout the town. Mornington Penisula is another of my favourite
                Victorian destinations, the beaches and the scenery are so unique and beauitful. That's where I took the picture of the seals 
                sleeping. Out in the bay, about a kilometer off shore, are these Gazebos for the seals to use and if you go at the right time 
                you can scuba dive with seal pups.
